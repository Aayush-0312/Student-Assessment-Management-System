🎓 Student Assessment Management System
________________________________________
Overview

This is a simple console-based application built in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

The system helps manage and evaluate student marks department-wise (Computer Science, Mechanical, Civil, Chemical, etc.).

Users can enter marks subject- and question-wise, and the program automatically calculates total marks and percentage based on the student’s roll number.

Features

•	Menu-Driven Interface: Easy navigation for users to select departments and subjects.

•	Department Support: Each department has its own subjects and question sets.

•	Input Validation: Ensures marks entered are valid and within range.

•	Automatic Calculation: Computes total marks and percentage instantly.

•	Result Display: Shows clear output in x/y format along with percentage.

•	Scalable Design: Built using OOP principles for easy future upgrades like file handling or database integration.

Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to simplify student assessment management and demonstrate the practical implementation of OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism in a real-world scenario.

How It Works

1.	User selects a department from the main menu.
2.	The system loads subjects and questions related to that department.
3.	User enters marks for each subject or question.
4.	System performs input validation, calculates total marks, and determines the percentage.
5.	The result is displayed in a clear and readable format (x/y marks + percentage).
